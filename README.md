# Frappe-Phalguni-Singh-
I have completed the task of Frappe hiring test and permormed the task of create, read, update and, delete.
It will record while issuing books, and user can keep track of books issued to them.
User can create account for themselves.
In this task I have created a table for book, library branch, store the book copies, and book authors.

In the next step, I have inserted the required data in tables and created librarian table structure.
I have added data for pending registrations table and primary keys for the tables.
It accepts title, authors, isbn, publisher and page as parameters.
